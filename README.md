# ReverbOnDeath
Adds a heavy reverb effect to a player's voice for their final moments before dying. It is meant to emulate the effect in videos like this.

Special thanks to This Guy#5144 who initially posted this idea on the modding Discord, and also to egeadam, whose code from MoreScreams heavily influenced the code for this mod.

Feel free to reach out to me for any bug reports or suggestions.
